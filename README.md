  📝 ***How the Game Works – Explained Simply***


Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic hand game played between two people (in this case, a player vs. the computer). Each player chooses one of the three options:

  - 🪨 Rock

  - 📄 Paper

  - ✂️ Scissors


   🆚 ***Who Beats Who?***

 1. Rock and	Scissors = Rock crushes Scissors - Rock Wins
 2. Paper	and Rock = Paper covers Rock  -  Paper Wins
 3. Scissors	and Paper = Scissors cut Paper  - Scissors Wins

 📌 If both players choose the same, it's a draw!
